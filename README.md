Social SDK: 
Social SDK is a current in progress SDK for Social a not yet in progress VR Game, Social contains special tools, and Unity Editor Windows for Compiling Unity scenes, and avatars into dynamic loadable bundles, that can be used to send across the interet to other clients. With the bundle approach this allows for the players to be able to loadup a unity project drag and drop the Unitypackage and then make what their minds think of, then package it then upload it to a Server that doesn't need to be rebooted for a refresh. 

Also allowing for smaller RAM use, outside use for making bundles for other games, and being able to make any Unity scene into two files, and being able to just load the two files and load the scene.
